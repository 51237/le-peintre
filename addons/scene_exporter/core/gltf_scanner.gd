# gltf_scanner.gd — finds external buddy files referenced by a .gltf.
#
# Why this exists: .gltf is a JSON document that references its binary
# geometry (`.bin`) and, optionally, textures via external URIs. Those
# buddies are plain files — not Godot Resources — so they don't appear in
# `ResourceLoader.get_dependencies()` and the dep walker misses them.
# Without this scanner we ship the .gltf stripped of its geometry and the
# target project can't import the model.
#
# Who calls: core/exporter.gd during plan(), right after the dep walk.
#
# Scope: URIs that resolve to local files only. data: URIs are skipped
# (they're embedded, no file to ship). http(s): URIs produce a warning —
# shipping a portable package of a net-dependent asset is out of scope.
# .glb is intentionally NOT scanned: it's a self-contained binary container.
